- 2025-09-28T00:50:24.782Z – Story intake baseline synced.
- Drafted automation manifest (`docs/automation-manifest.md` v1.1.0) defining sequential and parallel phases plus agent commands.

## 🔄 IN PROGRESS
- None – awaiting next story update cycle.

## 📋 PENDING TASKS
- Enrich `docs/story-overview.md` and `docs/asset-inventory.md` with the latest narrative once available.
- Extend asset registries when new categories are introduced (update manifest & scenes accordingly).
- Add automated SVGO compression step to the QA phase when ready.

## 🎯 PRIORITY ORDER
- Await story payload ➝ update docs ➝ rerun automation pipeline.
- Expand asset library per new beats.
- Evaluate need for additional compositions or transitions.

## 📊 PROGRESS TRACKING
- Manifest version: 1.1.0
- Sequential phases defined: 4
- Parallel-enabled phases: 2

## 🔧 TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
- Orchestrator must respect manifest dependency graph and emit phase completion before spawning dependents.
- Parallel asset/animation agents must write to disjoint paths and rely on registry JSON merges.
- TODO.md to be updated after every automation run with timestamped notes.

## 📝 NOTES
- Documentation agents should update timeline-grid.md whenever beats shift.
- All future agents should source pipeline metadata from `docs/automation-manifest.md` instead of hardcoding stage order.
