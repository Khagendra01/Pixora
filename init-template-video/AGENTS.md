# Agents Guidance Retired

All agent operating procedures now live in three docs:
- `MISSION-BRIEF.md` for story intake and execution order
- `AUTOMATION-AGENT.md` for the step-by-step production runbook
- `PRODUCTION-GUARDRAILS.md` for structure, naming, and QA requirements

Please refer to those files for the latest guidance.
