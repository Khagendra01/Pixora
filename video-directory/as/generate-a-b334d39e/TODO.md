# Video Generation TODO System

## Current Tasks

### âœ… Completed
- [x] Basic project structure setup
- [x] HelloWorld component created
- [x] Asset generation tools configured
- [x] Create MainScene component for story-driven videos
- [x] Update AGENTS.md with main scene requirements
- [x] Register MainScene in Root.jsx
- [x] Create TODO.md system for task tracking

### ðŸ”„ In Progress
- [ ] Test MainScene component functionality

### ðŸ“‹ Pending
- [ ] Implement story-driven animation logic
- [ ] Create character animation components
- [ ] Add background animation system
- [ ] Implement narrative structure (3-act format)
- [ ] Add emotional pacing controls
- [ ] Create object/prop animation system

## Story Generation Pipeline

### Phase 1: Story Analysis
- [ ] Parse user story request
- [ ] Extract characters, setting, conflict
- [ ] Identify emotional tone and pacing
- [ ] Design narrative arc (setup â†’ conflict â†’ resolution)

### Phase 2: Asset Creation
- [ ] Generate story-specific SVG assets using parallel generator
- [ ] Create character designs matching story protagonist
- [ ] Design background matching story setting
- [ ] Generate story-relevant objects/props
- [ ] Download appropriate audio files

### Phase 3: Animation Implementation
- [ ] Create MainScene component with story structure
- [ ] Implement 3-act timeline (0-300, 300-600, 600-900 frames)
- [ ] Add character animation system
- [ ] Implement background/environmental effects
- [ ] Create object interaction animations
- [ ] Add emotional pacing controls

### Phase 4: Polish & Export
- [ ] Quality check for story coherence
- [ ] Verify animation timing and smoothness
- [ ] Test asset imports and paths
- [ ] Ensure proper composition registration
- [ ] Export final video

## Critical Requirements

### MANDATORY: Use Parallel Asset Generation
```bash
# ALWAYS use this for asset creation
bash tools/force-parallel-assets.sh
```

### Story Structure Requirements
- **Setup (0-300 frames)**: Character introduction, setting establishment
- **Conflict (300-600 frames)**: Challenge presentation, tension building
- **Resolution (600-900 frames)**: Outcome delivery, emotional payoff

### Component Requirements
- MainScene component must be story-driven
- Must support dynamic asset loading
- Must implement 3-act narrative structure
- Must include emotional pacing controls

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Story is clear and engaging without explanation
- [ ] Characters are visually distinct and story-appropriate
- [ ] Setting matches story location and mood
- [ ] Animation supports narrative flow
- [ ] Emotional impact is achieved
- [ ] Technical quality is solid (smooth animation, proper timing)
