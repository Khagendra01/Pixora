# Daisy Bell Story Overview

## Logline
In Edwardian London, inventor Harry serenades Daisy with his self-built tandem bicycle, syncing their ride to the waltzing lilt of "Daisy Bell" while proving that love and engineering can share the same rhythm.

## Narrative Beat Summary
1. **Workshop Waltz** – Soft music-box chimes float through Harry's bicycle workshop where blueprints and half-assembled gears hint at meticulous craftsmanship. Daisy arrives just as Harry unveils a freshly polished tandem glowing under warm lamplight.
2. **Parkside Promenade** – The pair pedal through a springtime park: cherry blossoms swirl, onlookers smile, and synchronized wheel spokes flash in time with the chorus. A subtle camera orbit reveals the couple's chemistry.
3. **Moonlit Finale** – Their ride bursts into a lantern-lit square where friends cheer. Daisy accepts Harry's marriage proposal as the music swells, and the scene freezes on a radiant close-up of the couple framed by glowing daisies.

## Tone & Visual Direction
- **Colour Palette** – Warm brass, fern green, and buttercream yellow accented with moonlit lavender for evening highlights.
- **Lighting** – Transition from lamp-lit interiors to sun-dappled afternoon, ending with soft twilight glows and twinkling lanterns.
- **Animation Feel** – Graceful, looping waltz motions with gentle secondary motion (floating petals, swinging lanterns) guided by the song's 3/4 tempo.

## Audio Notes
- Primary soundtrack: public-domain recording or instrumental of "Daisy Bell" in 3/4 waltz time, 20s excerpt trimmed to match scene beats.
