|-------|------------------|----------|-------------------|-------------|
| 1A | 0s – 2.5s (0-75f) | 2.5s | Intro arpeggio | Close-up on a gramophone crank; sparks of dust drift in lamplight. |
| 1B | 2.5s – 5s (75-150f) | 2.5s | Verse lead-in | Reveal Harry buffing the tandem frame; Daisy enters, smiling. |
| 2A | 5s – 9s (150-270f) | 4s | Verse phrase | Tandem launches from workshop into park, camera dolly forward. |
| 2B | 9s – 12s (270-360f) | 3s | Chorus “Daisy, Daisy” | Orbit around couple; cherry blossoms swirl to rhythm. |
| 3A | 12s – 16s (360-480f) | 4s | Chorus continuation | Lanterns ignite as they enter town square; crowd waves. |

## Transition Notes
- **Scene 1 → Scene 2**: Match cut from spinning gear to spinning front wheel.
- **Scene 2 → Scene 3**: Use lantern light flares that bloom into evening ambience.
- **Final Hold**: Last 12 frames hold the freeze-frame while petals drift forward.

## Tempo Alignment
- Song in 3/4 time at ~90 BPM gives 0.8 seconds per measure; align animation cues every 24 frames.
- Petal particle bursts triggered on downbeats (frames 150, 174, 198, etc.) using seeded randomness for repeatability.
